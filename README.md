# GPX Data in Python

This repository shows how to import gpx data into Python dataframes for mapping and analysis.

Libraries used include Pandas, GeoPandas and MovingPandas, as well as BeautifulSoup for parsing.

A flake is provided for nix users, although after entering the shell the first time, you need to `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For non-nix users, additional required packages are listed in the `flake.nix` file.
